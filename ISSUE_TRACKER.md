**Status:** ❌ NOT FIXED

### 4. CLIP Validation Not Tested
**Symptom:** Need to test on existing 190 products
**Impact:** Unknown if CLIP scoring works

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Processing Pipeline Flow:
1. `/api/process` endpoint receives POST request ✓
2. Starts background thread ✓
3. Gets unprocessed products from DB ?
4. Calls processor.process_batch() ?
5. Downloads images ?
6. Updates database ?
7. Returns progress updates ?

### Potential Failure Points:
- [ ] Thread not actually running
- [ ] Database query not returning products
- [ ] process_batch failing silently
- [ ] Image download failing
- [ ] Database update failing
- [ ] Progress state not updating correctly

- [ ] Ensure database commits happen

### Priority 2: Fix Products Page UI
- [ ] Remove broken CSS
- [ ] Simplify table structure
- [ ] Fix column alignment
- [ ] Test responsive layout

### Priority 3: Test CLIP Validation
- [ ] Run on 190 existing products
- [ ] Verify scores are calculated
- [ ] Check if actions are applied

### Priority 4: Verify Image Storage

## IMPLEMENTATION LOG

### Step 1: Database Investigation
**Time:** 15:58
**Finding:** ALL 3,752 products marked as not_processed, ZERO have downloaded_image_path
**Issue:** Previous work lost, database was reset during import

### Step 2: Fix Processing Pipeline
**Time:** 15:59
**Action:** Added detailed logging to /api/process endpoint
**Next:** Test with 1 product to trace exact failure point

### Step 3: Fixed Download Issues  
**Time:** 18:00
**Finding:** Images were being found but URL wasn't included in results
**Fix 1:** Added URL to evaluate_results_with_variant_matching return
**Fix 2:** Added proper headers to bypass 403 errors
**Result:** Images now downloading successfully!

### Step 4: Database Not Updating
**Time:** 18:01  
**Issue:** Images saved to disk but database shows 0 products with downloaded_image_path
**Critical:** Database update is failing silently after image save

### Step 5: FIXED Database Path Issue
**Time:** 18:08
**Root Cause:** App using default nwk_images.db, we're checking data/products.db
**Fix:** Changed app.py to use ImageDatabase('data/products.db')
**Result:** Database updates now working, images processing successfully
