# üîÑ Latest System Updates

## Date: September 8, 2025

### ‚úÖ **MAJOR FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

---

## 1. üîç **SEARCH QUERY OVERHAUL - EXACT PRODUCT TITLES ONLY**

### Previous Issue:
- System was searching for barcodes instead of product names
- Search query: `"696009673280089 packshot"` (just numbers!)
- Zero products were being found despite 100+ API calls

### Fix Applied:
- **ALL search functions now use EXACT product title ONLY**
- **NO barcode searching anywhere in the system**
- **NO extra keywords added**

#### Changed Files:
- `config.yaml`: 
  - `query_template: "{title}"` - uses exact product name
  - `sa_keywords: ""` - no extra keywords
- `image_processor.py`:
  - `build_enhanced_search_query()` - uses title only
  - `build_search_query()` - uses title only
  - `web_search()` - uses title only

### Example:
```
Product: Nu Look Polish Floor & Furniture Black 1L
Old Query: "696009673280089 packshot South Africa product"
New Query: "Nu Look Polish Floor & Furniture Black 1L"
```

## 2. üõë **STOP BUTTON ADDED TO UI**

### Features:
- **Red STOP button** appears when processing starts
- **Gracefully stops processing** without shutting down the entire program
- **Shows current progress** when stopped
- **Automatically hides** when processing completes

### Implementation:
- **Frontend** (`templates/dashboard.html`):
  - Added red stop button next to Process All button
  - Shows/hides dynamically based on processing state
  - Confirmation dialog before stopping

- **Backend** (`app.py`):
  - New `/api/stop-processing` endpoint
  - `stop_requested` flag in processing state
  - Checks for stop requests during batch processing
  - Graceful shutdown with status message

### How to Use:
1. Click "Process All" to start processing
2. Red "üõë STOP Processing" button appears
3. Click it to stop at any time
4. Processing stops after current product
5. Shows how many products were processed

## 3. üìâ **CLIP THRESHOLDS LOWERED**

### Previous:
- `auto_approve: 70%` - Too strict, nothing was passing
- `needs_review: 40%`
- `auto_reject: 25%`

### New:
- `auto_approve: 45%` - More reasonable threshold
- `needs_review: 25%` - Saves more for review
- `auto_reject: 15%` - Only rejects really bad matches

---

## 4. üîÑ **INFINITE LOOP FIXED**

### Issue:
- Products with `not_found` status were being processed repeatedly
- Progress was going over 100% (reached 118%!)

### Fix:
- Takes a snapshot of SKUs to process at the start
- Never attempts the same SKU twice in one run
- Progress properly capped at 100%
- Exits when all intended SKUs are attempted

- Check logs to verify search queries are using product titles
- Monitor approved/pending ratio to tune thresholds
- Force web search bypasses cache for fresh results
